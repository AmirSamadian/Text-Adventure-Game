We don’t know who, but the lunatic is obsessed with riddles and hidden clues. I just wish the clues were written on paper rather than hidden in bodies. Who knows how many people he’s killed, but he sent us a teasing message revealing that there’s 8 bodies that he’s used as just clues. The whole country knows that where the first clue is, it’s so obviously hung on the clock tower. We need you to investigate that body and use the clues to find all bodies. Be careful when examining the body, you wouldn’t want to get contaminated. Eventually the clues will lead you right to him, just beware since he’ll have home field advantage'.

The body has already been lowered from the tower by the police. It’s lying on a tarp on the floor.
“This is brutal. The body looks inhumane, it’s unnatural in every way possible. Whoever did this had goals beyond just killing this person. It looks as if it’s transforming into a different being.

In the slums lies a 20 floor, damaged apartment complex with a large LED sign that says Mulberry. 
“Based on the clue, I assume the body is on the roof, so I’ll begin examining from top down.”
You are at the roof. There are AC units and antennas everywhere. After a few minutes of zigzagging through the AC units and antennas, you notice a green liquid dripping from an AC unit. We need to reveal the body from under the AC unit. “There it is. The body looks just like the last: sick, green, and morphing. It has the same cut marks and bubbles. This seems like a common theme.”

Casino: 
You must do a search of the casino but must first inform the owner that he’s required by the police department to clear the building for this search. After going to the officer guarding the door and informing him about the search, he calls the owner of the casino and approves the search. Everyone has fled the building and it’s time to search.  

After a thorough search, Falcone was able to find the body on the ceiling of the janitor’s office. The body is horizontally hanging from wall to wall with her feet glued to one wall and her arms to the opposing wall. There’s a toy car on the woman’s stomach. As usual, the body is morphing and has green bubbles dripping green liquid. This made a puddle under the woman.

Falcone hopped in the R8 and drove over the Nightfall Bridge. You weren’t able to find anything suspicious on the top of the bridge. You decide to search under the bridge before leaving. “Good thing I checked down here…Never mind… this is pure gore! The body is hanging from a hook connected to the bottom of the bridge. Let me lower this thing to take a closer look.”

“Sure thing!” – assistant

Jazz Club: 
“We didn’t have to travel far for this one as it’s in this same rich part of the city.”
 The Jazz Club is packed with men in suits and women in dresses. Everyone seems to be having a sophisticated conversation while drinking coffee as they wait for the Louis Armstrong performance in 15 minutes. You look around for hints of green blood as you walk through the club. You notice a small circular burn mark on the drum set on stage. You look closer and see a splash of green by the drum.

Ancient Library: 
You get a call from your assistant: “Mr. Falcone, I noticed a delayed output from the scanner. Just out of curiosity, sir, I did some digging on the final clue. I’m sure by now you’ve already figured out the location of the last body, but this information may help. There’s this very ancient book called “Odd One Out” written by an old mathematician about his theory of prime numbers. The book is located in the library’s 21st floor. Hopefully this book helps with whatever this lunatic has planned next” – Assistant

“That’s very helpful Alfred, I’ll head to the 21st floor now” – Falcone

After searching the 21st floor for 15 minutes, you found the book. After pulling out the book, the entire shelf flipped around revealing the body. The body is disgustingly stoned to the wall and next to it are five unit vector component notations. These are likely addresses to the next step. The Audi can convert this cryptic notation into an address and take you there, you just have to pick the correct address.

This looks like an abandoned building. It’s nighttime and there are no lights on. You enter the building and see nothing due to the darkness, but before you can move, a giant cage falls from the room and traps you inside. The cage is electrically powered. The electricity allows for a force field that prevents anything from passing through it. 
From the darkness, a glowing green object approaches you, as it gets closer, things start to clear up and you see a man in a lab coat holding a syringe gun with glowing, bubbly green fluid in it.
“Falcone…what took you so long? It’s rude to keep your toughest challenge waiting. HAHA. I’m glad that you finally get to put a face to the man who’s been terrorizing your small brain this whole time since the clock tower incident. Now let me introduce myself… I am the Riddler, master of clues. Riddle me this: do you recognize this old man?” - Riddler
The green lights of the warehouse turn on and a group of 10 goons wearing grey jackets bring a body in front of you.
“NOOOOOO! You’re an absolute lunatic! I HATEE YOUUU! Why would you do this? Officer Bob Marshall has done nothing but provide justice and safety for this city!” – Falcone
“HAHAHAAAA this is GREAT! I’ve never seen you get so rowdy and uncontrollable. Don’t worry Falcone, I didn’t have anything against him, he was just in the way. Everyone in this city will be gifted this opportunity. A new life! They’ll transform into a being much more powerful than humans. You see, this radioactive syringe that I hold in my hand has been responsible for all the people you found unconscious. That’s right, they’re not dead. They will get back up ready to enjoy their new body. But of course, a syringe isn’t that effective. How about we go booom! HAHAHAHA” – Riddler
The riddler and his goons leave the room and you are stuck in this cage. 

“While the Riddler was busy laughing, I was able to observe the jackets the goons were wearing. They all had grey jackets with the same logo. The logo said Uptown Mall. This is the only lead I have since they took Bob Marshall’s body with them. First I have to get out of this cage.” – Falcone

You slammed the escrima sticks into the ground which created an electrical blast that entered the power box of the cage and disabled the electricity allowing you to escape the cage. Look for the key to this abandoned building to go to the mall.

mall parking: 
It’s 4 AM as you’re in your Audi R8 driving toward the mall’s parking. You notice that two jacked goons are guarding the mall’s entrance with machine guns. You didn’t approach sneakily so they noticed your trademark car first and fired some shots at it. Luckily, you turned around quickly and didn’t take any damage.
“Their weapons outpower mine, I must find a sneaky approach to killing them and entering the mall. There’s a hill bordering the parking lot and there are many trees for cover. I should drive to the bottom and walk all the way up” - Falcone
You are now at the top of the hill and the goons have no idea. Shoot them with one of your guns.

mall parking: 
It’s 4 AM as you’re in your Audi R8 driving toward the mall’s parking. You notice that two jacked goons are guarding the mall’s entrance with machine guns. You didn’t approach sneakily so they noticed your trademark car first and fired some shots at it. Luckily, you turned around quickly and didn’t take any damage.
“Their weapons outpower mine, I must find a sneaky approach to killing them and entering the mall. There’s a hill bordering the parking lot and there are many trees for cover. I should drive to the bottom and walk all the way up” - Falcone
You are now at the top of the hill and the goons have no idea. Shoot them with one of your guns.

You killed guard 1 and guard 2 was confused as to where he got shot from since falcones daily is a silenced pistol.By the time he could react, you killed him too. Go get the key to the mall from their clothes and enter the mall.

mall: 
You are now in this empty mall. Based on the fact that goons were guarding this mall, it’s certain that you’re in the right place. Sneaking and searching this ginormous mall was tedious, but eventually, you heard a group of 10 armed goons cracking jokes as they were guarding a room. Whatever that room is must be important, but you must kill all goons before you can enter. 
“I must be smart with the way I choose to attack. I need to pick a weapon or combination of weapons that allows me to kill them all at once or one-by-one without interference from the others.” – Falcone

Radioactive Warehouse in Mall: 
You have opened the door and see a stairway going down into a warehouse. You hear a maniacal laugh as you walk down the stairs. The riddler is dancing with joy as the countdown on the bomb keeps going down but doesn’t see you. It’s at 59 seconds.
“Riddle me this dumbass” – Falcone
“How did you - ” – Riddler
You knocked out the riddler and killed him with your bare hands. Deactivate the bomb. You have 10 seconds.
